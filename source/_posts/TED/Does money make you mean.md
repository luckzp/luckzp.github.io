# Does money make you mean?

### what are we facing? 

American dream is an idea in which **we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper, as long as we apply ourselves and work hard.** And a piece of that means that sometimes, you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you. But **what we're finding is that the wealthier you are, the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success, of achievement and accomplishment, to the detriment of others around you.**

<!--more--> 

We're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality. What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals, but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us. And if it's the case, as we've been finding, that **the wealthier you are, the more entitled you feel to that wealth, and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people, and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest.**

### what do we do? 

we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions,can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy. For instance, **reminding people of the benefits of cooperation or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.**
